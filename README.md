# speed-of-thought-lisp
Write emacs-lisp at the speed of thought.

This defines a new global minor-mode `speed-of-thought-mode`, which
activates locally on any supported buffer. Currently, only
`emacs-lisp-mode` buffers are supported.

The mode is quite simple, and is composed of two parts:

## Abbrevs

A large number of abbrevs which expand function
initials to their name.  A few examples:

- `wcb` -> `with-current-buffer`
- `i` -> `insert`
- `r` -> `require '`
- `a` -> `and`

However, these are defined in a way such that they ONLY expand in a
place where you would use a function, so hitting SPC after `(r`
expands to `(require '`, but hitting SPC after `(delete-region r` will
NOT expand the `r`, because that's obviously not a function.
Furthermore, `#'r` will expand to `#'require` (note how it omits that
extra quote, since it would be useless here).

## Commands

It also defines four commands, which really fit into this "follow the
thought-flow" way of writing.  The bindings are as follows, I
understand these don't fully adhere to conventions, and I'd
appreciate suggestions on better bindings.

- `M-RET` :: Break line, and insert "()" with point in the middle.
- `C-RET` :: Do `forward-up-list', then do M-RET.

Hitting RET followed by a `(' was one of the most common key sequences
for me while writing elisp, so giving it a quick-to-hit key was a
significant improvement.

- `C-c f` :: Find function under point.  If it is not defined, create a
definition for it below the current function and leave point inside.
- `C-c v` :: Same, but for variable.

With these commands, you just write your code as you think of it.  Once
you hit a "stop-point" of sorts in your thought flow, you hit `C-c f/v`
on any undefined functions/variables, write their definitions, and hit
`C-u C-SPC` to go back to the main function.

## Small Example

With the above (assuming you use something like paredit or
electric-pair-mode), if you write:

   ( w t b M-RET i SPC text

You get

   (with-temp-buffer (insert text))
